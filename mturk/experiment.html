    <p class="legal">This HIT is part of a scientific research project conducted by the Social Learning Lab at Stanford and has been approved by the IRB of Stanford University. Your decision to complete this HIT is voluntary. We will only have access to your worker ID and no other information to identify you. The only other information we will have, in addition to your response, is the time at which you completed the survey and the amount of time you spent to complete it. The results of the research may be presented at scientific meetings or published in scientific journals. Clicking on the ‘SUBMIT’ button on the bottom of this page indicates that you are at least 18 years of age, and agree to complete this HIT voluntarily.</p>
    
    <p>You will first see <strong>100</strong> number sequences (121 over the course of the whole experiment) and be asked which number comes next. For example:<p>
    <p class="numseq">1 2 3 4 <input type="text"></p>
    <p>The sequences are generated by simple rules. The rules can be either deterministic (there is only one possible next number, like the last number +1 or sum of the last two numbers) or random (e.g. one of the three closest numbers bigger than the last number). There may be more than one rule consistent with the sequence you have seen! It is your job to guess the next number in the sequence.</p>
    <p>When you have typed in your guess, press the <strong>submit</strong> button at the bottom of each page. You will see the correct next number and the underlying rule. Feel free to use the calculator provided on the page. Try it out now:</p>
    <div align="center"><object data="calculator.html" width="325px" height="270px"></object></div>
    <p>The HIT should take 15 minutes. Please pay attention. Thanks!</p>

    <h1>You're doing great!</h1>
    <p>In this part, you will see <strong>21</strong> more number sequences, but now you get to make a choice to help you figure out the underlying rule! Remember, more than one rule could fit the sequence you see, so you should pick the number that helps you figure out the underlying rule the best.</p> 
    <p>When the sequence appears on the screen, you will fill in two things: your best guess at the underlying rule and the next number in the sequence that will best help you figure out the rule. For your guess of the rule, please do not write things like "don't know" or gibberish. For the next number choice, please limit your responses to finite integers (e.g., numbers like -5 or 10); decimals are not acceptable. Feedback from the program will not actually be given, but please make your choices as if it were given.</p>
